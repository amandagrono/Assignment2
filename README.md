SignUpForm is a simple application that asks for a user to input information including their name, email, a password, and a password confirmation. 
If any information is not filled out, it displays a toast saying that some information is not entered. 
If the password and confirmation do not match, it also displays a toast error message. 
If all information is filled out correctly, the text changes and welcomes the user into the application, and the save button changes to a reset button so 
the user can then input new information.
